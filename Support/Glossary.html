Some states judge emergencies by the "prudent layperson" law, meaning that the health plan must cover a trip to the emergency room "if a prudent layperson, acting reasonably, would have believed that an emergency medical condition existed." Keep in mind that some plans won't cover a trip to the emergency room if the symptoms appeared more than 24 hours earlier.</li>
                      <li><strong>Endorsement</strong> - Attachment or addendum to an insurance policy; an endorsement changes the contract's original terms.</li>
